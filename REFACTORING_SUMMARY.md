## What Was Changed

### 1. Hero Section (Above Fold)

**Before:**
- Generic headline: "Strategic Real Estate Investment & Property Redevelopment"
- Vague subheadline about "disciplined market research"
- Generic CTAs: "Contact Us" | "Learn More"

**After:**
- Specific headline: "Value-Add Real Estate Investment in Undervalued Markets"
- Actionable subheadline: "Stehnova Holdings LLC identifies underperforming properties in emerging markets, applies operational expertise to unlock value, and delivers returns through disciplined redevelopment."
- Intent-based CTAs: "Submit an Opportunity" | "View Investment Criteria"

**Why This Matters:**
- "Value-Add" is specific investment strategy terminology
- "Undervalued Markets" signals geographic focus without being too narrow
- CTAs differentiate between deal sources and investors immediately
- Removes vague "strategic" language that doesn't mean anything

---

### 2. Investment Focus Section (New)

**What It Is:**
A new section that answers "What do we invest in?" with specific, actionable information:

- **Asset Classes:** Multifamily, mixed-use, and commercial properties with value-add potential
- **Geography:** Underserved markets with demographic and economic tailwinds
- **Strategy:** Acquire underperforming assets, improve operations, reposition for higher yields
- **Deal Size:** $1M - $10M acquisition range with flexible capital structures

**Why This Matters:**
- Specific asset classes (not just "real estate")
- Clear deal size range shows operational readiness
- Geographic focus without being too narrow
- Operational strategy mentioned upfront

---

### 3. Value Creation Section (New)

**What It Is:**
A 4-step process flow showing "How we create value":

1. **Identify:** Rigorous underwriting with conservative assumptions and multiple exit scenarios
2. **Optimize:** Operational improvements, tenant retention strategies, and physical upgrades
3. **Reposition:** Strategic rebranding, lease restructuring, and market positioning
4. **Exit:** Disciplined disposition through institutional buyers or refinance

**Why This Matters:**
- Shows clear process, not just intent
- Each step is actionable
- Mentions specific tactics (tenant retention, lease restructuring)
- Includes exit strategy - shows full-cycle thinking

---

### 4. Why Stehnova Section (New)

**What It Is:**
A credibility section with 5 institutional signals:

- **Founder-Operator Mindset:** We think like owners, not just capital allocators
- **Institutional Discipline:** We apply the same rigor as larger firms to smaller deals
- **Active Asset Management:** We don't acquire and forget—we actively manage every property
- **Transparent Communication:** Regular reporting and clear expectations with all stakeholders
- **Long-Term Partnerships:** We build relationships, not just transactions

**Why This Matters:**
- "Founder-Operator" signals skin in the game
- "Institutional Discipline" suggests sophistication without claiming size
- "Active Asset Management" differentiates from passive investors
- "Transparent Communication" addresses investor concerns
- "Long-Term Partnerships" signals relationship-focused approach

---

### 5. Investment Criteria Section (New)

**What It Is:**
A concrete, tangible proof section showing operational readiness:

**Asset Type:**
- Multifamily: 5-50 units, Class B/C locations
- Mixed-Use: Retail + residential or commercial components
- Commercial: Office, retail, or industrial with value-add potential

**Geography:**
- Primary focus: Underserved markets with demographic and economic tailwinds

- Purchase price: $1M - $10M
- Cash-on-cash return target: 8-12%+
- Hold period: 3-7 years
- Value-add opportunity: Minimum 15% upside through improvements or repositioning

**Operational Requirements:**

**Why This Matters:**

- Filters unqualified leads early
- Gives investors confidence you have a clear process
- Creates a tangible artifact that feels institutional

### 6. About Section (Enhanced)

**Before:**
- Two brief, vague sentences
- "Strategic real estate investment through disciplined analysis"
- "Building capital structures for long-term growth"

**After:**
- Comprehensive narrative explaining the company's premise and approach
- Clear mission statement
- Clear vision statement
- "Partner With Us" CTA

**Narrative:**
"Stehnova Holdings LLC was founded on a simple premise: smaller real estate deals deserve the same analytical rigor and operational discipline applied to institutional transactions.

We identify undervalued properties in emerging markets, apply operational expertise to unlock value, and deliver returns through disciplined redevelopment. Our approach combines the agility of a boutique firm with the systematic processes of larger institutions.

We believe that value creation happens through active management—not just capital allocation. That's why we don't acquire and forget. We actively manage every property in our portfolio, implementing operational improvements, tenant retention strategies, and physical upgrades to maximize returns.

Our team brings together expertise in real estate investment, property management, and market analysis. We're operators first, investors second—and that mindset drives every decision we make."

**Mission:**
"To generate superior risk-adjusted returns through disciplined value-add real estate investment while building lasting partnerships with investors, operators, and communities."

**Vision:**
"To become the trusted partner for value-add real estate investment in our target markets, known for operational excellence, transparent communication, and consistent execution."

**Why This Matters:**
- Provides company narrative and context
- Explains the "why" behind the firm
- Mission and vision give direction
- More substantial without being verbose
- Signals institutional mindset
